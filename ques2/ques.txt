Write a Java program to demonstrate the use of primitive data types and type conversion. 
The program should:
Declare and initialize variables of different primitive data types (int, double, char, and boolean).
Perform type conversion by converting an int to a double and a char to an int.
Print the values of all variables before and after the conversions.
