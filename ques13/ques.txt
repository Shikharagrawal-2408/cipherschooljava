Problem Description:
Write a method to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

Input: str = ""madam""
Output: true

Input: str = ""hello""
Output: false

Explanation:
For the input string ""madam"", it reads the same forwards and backwards, so the output is true. For ""hello"", 
it does not, so the output is false.
